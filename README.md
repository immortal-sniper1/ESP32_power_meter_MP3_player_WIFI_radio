# PCB_test_project_01
 First ESP32 pcb project, it will have power meters( 24V 3A, 5V 0.5A, and self consumption), sd card, WIFI/BT and the ability to play back MP3/audio file.     
 Also it will feature a power usage meter. Maybe it will aso have battery power option, i am considering Li-Po and LiFePO4 , i will decide based on the BMS es i find vailable.
